Neuropiq Workspace Analysis and Development Roadmap
üîç Project Overview
Neuropiq is a sophisticated distributed neuroscience experimentation platform designed for scalable, reproducible, and real-time behavioral experiments. It follows a modular architecture that enables researchers to conduct experiments across multiple hardware platforms (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, desktop) with distributed computing capabilities.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Organization
The project follows a well-structured layered architecture:

1. Core Layer (core)
config.py: Comprehensive configuration management using Pydantic models
experiment.py: Main experiment execution engine
protocol.py: Protocol orchestration and management
scheduler.py: Task scheduling and timing coordination
Purpose: Provides the foundational system configuration, experiment coordination, and core business logic.

2. Hardware Abstraction Layer (hardware)
base.py: Abstract base classes for all hardware components
sensors/: Camera, beam break, force plate sensors
actuators/: LED, servo, speaker actuators
interfaces/: GPIO, I2C, serial communication interfaces
Purpose: Abstracts hardware interactions with simulation support, enabling platform-agnostic experiment design.

3. Protocol System (protocols)
base.py: Protocol framework with registry system
behavioral/: Fear conditioning, open field, operant conditioning protocols
templates/: Reusable protocol templates
Purpose: Defines experimental protocols with standardized interfaces, parameter validation, and execution flow.

4. Distributed Computing Layer (distributed)
ray_cluster.py: Ray cluster management and monitoring
communication.py: Inter-node communication
rig_worker.py: Worker node management
server_coordinator.py: Distributed experiment coordination
Purpose: Enables scalable distributed experiments across multiple nodes with load balancing and fault tolerance.

5. Data Management Layer (data)
storage.py: Multi-backend data storage system
nwb_handler.py: Neurodata Without Borders integration
streaming.py: Real-time data streaming
validation.py: Data integrity validation
Purpose: Handles data persistence, streaming, and compliance with neuroscience data standards (NWB, BIDS).

6. Analysis Layer (analysis)
realtime/: Live behavior classification, motion tracking, freezing detection
offline/: Statistical analysis, visualization
Purpose: Provides both real-time behavioral analysis and post-experiment data processing capabilities.

7. Web Interface Layer (web)
app.py: FastAPI web application
api/: REST API endpoints
templates/: Web UI templates
Purpose: Offers web-based experiment control, real-time monitoring, and data visualization.

8. CLI Layer (cli)
main.py: Main command-line interface
deploy.py: Deployment utilities
setup.py: System setup and configuration
Purpose: Provides command-line tools for system management, experiment execution, and deployment.
